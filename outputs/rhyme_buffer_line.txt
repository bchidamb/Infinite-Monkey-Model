\f0\fs24 \cf2 \cb3 \CocoaLigature0 Loves 'tis that best flattery for to endured!\
Worse was jealousy such that says thus growing,\
Decease doth pay lends Love's at mayst assured \
Same aught novel those in power for her knowing \
Mine boast might great scope of self means not reason!\
Ruin that but to all saw to account \
Them excellence it so the flattery treason!\
Fuel doth deaths I thy me which mine surmount \
O in beck have am perfection I shore:\
With wherein I painting free till which none \
Seasons' evident foot stretched in more,\
Shall born on where when canker cruel one,\
Not and tongue-tied you with my 'scaped to cheek,\
Powers thee is love constant Muse waste and seek.}
